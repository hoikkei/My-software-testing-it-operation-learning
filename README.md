## 1. Functional Testing
- Goal: To verify that each software function works according to the requirements document or specifications.
- Focus: Ensures the correctness of functions by testing if the system's inputs yield the expected outputs, and whether the functionality meets business requirements.
- Test Scope:
User Interface
Database
Security
API
- Test Approach: Usually performed through manual testing or automated tools, using test cases to verify if the functionality operates correctly.
- Examples: Login function testing, shopping cart function testing, payment function testing, etc.

## 2. Performance Testing
- Goal: To evaluate the system’s performance under different load conditions, such as response time, throughput, and resource usage.
- Focus: Ensures the software runs efficiently and remains stable under heavy load, long operational periods, or high concurrent user access.
- Test Types:
- Load Testing: Tests the system's behavior under normal and high load conditions.
- Stress Testing: Assesses system performance under extreme loads to evaluate its stability.
- Capacity Testing: Verifies the maximum number of users or transactions the system can handle.
- Examples: Testing a website’s response time and page load speed under high concurrent user access.

## 3. Automated Testing in Development
- Goal: To reduce the workload of repetitive manual tests by writing automated scripts, improving test efficiency and coverage.
- Focus: Continuous testing during development through automation tools, ensuring that code integration and updates do not introduce new issues.
- Common Types of Automated Testing:
- Unit Testing: Tests individual modules or components for proper functionality.
- Integration Testing: Tests if multiple modules work together as expected.
- Regression Testing: After every code change, checks if new errors have been introduced.
- Examples: Using tools like Selenium, JUnit, or TestNG to automate functional or regression testing.

Summary of Differences
- Functional Testing: Focuses on verifying if the software functions as expected, typically performed through manual or automated tests.
- Performance Testing: Focuses on assessing the system's performance under varying load conditions, ensuring stability and efficiency.
- Automated Testing in Development: Involves writing and running automated test scripts to enhance development and testing efficiency, suitable for regression, unit, and integration testing.
