### Software testing overview

#### Functional testing of test development

### Chapter 1: Testing Theory
#### 1.1 Concept of Software Testing
Software Testing:
Software testing refers to operating a program under specified conditions (manual testing, automated testing) to identify errors, measure software quality, and evaluate whether it meets requirements.

Purpose of Software Testing:
It has specific objectives and methods: reporting errors, tracking errors, identifying issues with the software, and verifying if the system meets user needs.

#### Software Testing:
Testing ensures that the software meets user requirements and achieves the quality standards. It is usually performed by a dedicated testing team.

Common testing activities are divided into:

- Unit Testing: Testing each individual function or component of the code.
Integration Testing: Testing the combination of modules in a codebase.
- System Testing: Comprehensive testing of the entire system, simulating real-world use cases with assigned testers.

#### Software Maintenance:
At this stage, the software is delivered and operational for users. The maintenance phase ensures that the system runs smoothly, for example, a website running 24/7. Potential problems during this phase include:

Performance issues due to increased user demand.
System unavailability due to server problems.
Software bugs.
New bugs introduced during system upgrades.
When users encounter problems during use, they report them to technical support, which then forwards the issue to the testing team, and the development team fixes the problem.

#### 1.2 Software Testing Process
- Relevant Personnel:

-- Developers: Fix bugs.
-- Product Managers: Familiar with the product's business processes and communicate accordingly.
-- Customer Support/Business Staff: Forward bugs to testers for verification.
-- Implementation/Technical Support Engineers.
-- Designers: Review and understand requirements, learn about the business.

- Requirement Analysis:

-- Organize the key requirement points.
-- Discuss any unclear points until resolved.

- Test Planning:

-- Test Document Content: Clearly state objectives and timelines.
-- People involved in the test plan: Xiao Wang, Xiao Li, Xiao Zhang.
-- Task Distribution: Who is responsible for which functionality module, writing test cases.
-- Time Planning: Time for preparing test cases and for product testing.
-- Document Generation: Test cases, bug forms, software test reports.
-- Resource Requests: Number of servers, types of tests, required tools.

- Test Design Stage:

Write test cases based on requirement documents, system design, and evaluate coverage, stability, and usability of the product.
Test Execution Stage:

Set up the test environment, execute tests, verify, submit defects in the defect management system, track bugs until resolved.

- Test Evaluation Stage:

Evaluate Issues: Decide if the product passes or needs to be returned for further testing.
Assess the entire testing process and version quality to determine if it can be released.

-Test Passes, Launch:

If testing fails, the product is returned for retesting.

#### 1.4 Software Testing Models
- As software testing evolves, testers have summarized some common testing models. One example is the V-Model, which shares some characteristics with the waterfall model. The V-model outlines the development process from left to right, showing both development activities and corresponding testing stages.

- The value of the V-model is that it clearly identifies the different levels of testing and shows how these testing stages correspond to each phase of the development process.

- Limitations:
The V-model treats testing as the final activity after coding. Errors from earlier stages (e.g., requirement analysis) are only discovered in the later stages of testing.

Explanation of Model Phases:

- Unit Testing:
Also called module testing, it verifies the correctness of individual parts. Unit testing involves designing test cases based on the internal structure of the code. Modules can be tested independently.

What is a unit?

In Python, it could be a class.
For graphical software, it could be a window or a menu feature.
Integration Testing:
Also known as assembly testing, it tests the integration of all units in a structured manner.

- System Testing:
Testing the software system as a whole, covering functionality, performance, hardware, and software. For instance, testing whether multiple logins to QQ on different machines work properly, or testing the performance of QQ on different platforms like Windows and Linux.

- Acceptance Testing:

- Alpha Testing:
Alpha testing simulates real-world usage but is usually done with an early version of the product (e.g., a closed beta with limited access), where the software may still have many bugs and is not yet public.
- Beta Testing:
Beta testing is conducted after most bugs have been fixed in-house. It is released in real-world environments (open beta), though some bugs may still exist. For example, when a game like DNF releases a new map, it is tested by professional players, and feedback is given to developers.
- Gamma Version:
A gamma version is close to the official release, almost indistinguishable from the final version.

-W-Model for Software Testing Advantages:
Testing is involved throughout the software development lifecycle. Early involvement in testing can help identify and fix design flaws at a lower cost.

-W-Model for Software Testing Advantages Disadvantages:
It still depends on a linear relationship between development and testing. It cannot easily adapt to changes in requirements. Testing tasks are hard to execute without proper documentation. For complex business cases, new testers may struggle to understand requirements.

- Test Coverage
Test coverage is a measure of how much of the system has been tested and is also a measure of the effectiveness of testing techniques.

- Coverage = (Items tested at least once) / (Total number of items)

Key Points:

Coverage data checks if the testing is sufficient.
It helps analyze weak points in the testing and compare the results of different testers.


### Chapter 2 Examination Category

- Functional Testing — Testers manually test the GUI by clicking around (click, click, click testing).
- Automated Testing — Using scripts or programs to test other programs (testing APIs), freeing up manual effort.
- Performance Testing — Identifying system bottlenecks to ensure good performance and system stability.
- Black-Box Testing — Testing the application’s functionality by verifying that the output is correct without looking into the internal structure.
- White-Box Testing — Testing the internal structure of the program by designing test cases from a programming perspective.


#### 2.1 Software Testing Functional Classification
According to Testing Phases
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing

-Unit Testing
What is a unit? A memory module can be understood as a unit, or a small functional module.

Unit testing is the correctness checking of the basic unit (the smallest unit in software design).

The purpose of unit testing is to check if the software module fulfills the requirements in the design specification.

- Integration Testing
Integration testing is based on unit testing. It involves assembling all the modules according to the design into a subsystem for verification.

- System Testing
System testing involves configuring test staff, testing environment, and computer hardware environment to carry out the testing process.

- Differences Between Unit, Integration, and System Testing
Testing methods differ:
Unit testing falls under white-box testing.
Integration testing is part of gray-box testing.
System testing is considered black-box testing.

- Testing Scope Differs
Unit testing checks internal data structures, logic control, exception handling, etc.
Integration testing checks data transfer between modules.
System testing checks whether the whole software system meets the requirements.

#### 2.2 Regression Testing
- Information Flow in the Testing Process
Software configuration: requirement documents, design specifications, test code, etc.
Test environment configuration: test requirement specification, test plan, test cases, etc.
- Definition of Regression Testing
Regression testing is the activity performed after a defect has been found and fixed in software to verify if the defect has been corrected properly and whether it has affected other functionalities.

- Regression Testing Process
-- 1. Develop test strategy, including regression test strategy.
-- 2.Identify the version for regression testing.
-- 3.Execute regression testing according to the strategy.
-- 4.If regression passes, close the defect tracking ticket.
-- 5.If regression fails, return the defect ticket to the developer to fix the problem and retest.


- Regression Testing Strategy Design
-- Complete Repetition: Re-execute all previously defined test cases to verify correctness and potential side effects after the software modification.
-- Selective Repetition: Re-execute selected test cases.
Modification Coverage: Create new test cases to cover the modified areas and verify that no defects remain.
Impact Diffusion: Analyze if the modifications indirectly caused additional defects.
Target Achievement: Set goals, such as a specific percentage of test case coverage.
Automated Regression Testing
Due to the repetitive nature of regression testing and the potential for testers to lose enthusiasm, automated regression testing is essential.

A good automated regression testing activity includes:

-- Automated program execution.
-- Self-configuration of program parameters.
-- Automated test case management.
-- Automated execution of test activities.
-- Automated logging of test information.
-- Automated analysis and output of test results.
-- Automating test cases and performing result analysis is suitable for script-based test case development, logical control, and result assertions. Python is flexible for script development.

#### 2.3 Acceptance Testing
In the software lifecycle, testing activities include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and other in-house testing.

Before releasing the software, a real-user-involved testing activity is conducted, known as acceptance testing.

There are two forms of software project development:

Enterprise self-developed product: The company's own product is tested by users through large-scale internal and public testing to verify the correctness of the software.

Alpha testing.
Beta testing.
Customer-specific development: The product is developed based on client requirements, and the client performs acceptance testing to verify the correctness.

Overview of Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing involves determining the execution time, personnel, and environment after the software has passed internal system tests and configuration reviews.

It is mainly conducted manually, with testers and a group of representative users. It is typically carried out at the user’s base, or with their consent, at the software development company’s simulated test environment.

Results of acceptance testing can lead to either:

Acceptance of the software by the user.
Rejection if the software does not meet user expectations.

#### 2.4 Alpha Testing and Beta Testing
Alpha testing is like a closed test within the company in a simulated real environment. Employees conduct the test with feedback from developers.

Beta testing is similar to an open public test, where multiple users test the product in real-world conditions, such as on different devices, platforms, and networks. Developers don't control beta testing directly, and users provide feedback.

#### 2.5 Testing Phases
Testing consists of four main stages:

Test planning.
Test design.
Test case development.
Test reporting.

#### 2.6 Black-Box Testing
- Black-box testing, also known as functional testing, involves verifying software functionality based on user requirements, without considering the internal structure.

Examples include:

- Functionality testing: Testing whether a website or phone function works as expected.
- Capacity testing: Testing how the software handles large-scale data.
- Load testing: Testing how the system performs under high load.
- Recovery testing: Testing how well the system recovers from crashes or failures.

#### 2.7 White-Box Testing
White-box testing involves looking at the software's internal code and structure. It is a more rigorous approach to ensure the correctness of the program at the code level.

White-Box Testing Methods
Static analysis: Control flow analysis, data flow analysis, and information flow analysis.
Dynamic analysis: Logic coverage testing (branch testing, path testing), program instrumentation.
White-Box Testing Features
Understand software requirements.
Understand software code implementation.
Test code logic.
Check file paths in code.
White-box testing is more costly but ensures higher code coverage.

#### 2.8 Choosing Software Testing Methods
Black-box testing: Suitable when you know the product's specifications but not its internal implementation.
White-box testing: Suitable when you know the internal implementation and want to verify it meets the requirements.


#### Why Perform White-Box Testing?
If we only verify that the basic requirements of the product are met, why go to the trouble of testing the internal implementation? Black-box testing alone can only satisfy a certain level of coverage, and it cannot eliminate more hidden defects.

White-box testing, however, can detect issues from internal logic, provide higher coverage, and offer better assurance of software quality.

#### Features of White-Box Testing
-- Understand software requirements
-- Understand software code implementation
-- Test code logic
-- Test file paths within the code
-- White-box testing can be expensive

#### Methods of White-Box Testing
-- Static Analysis: Control flow analysis, data flow analysis, information flow analysis
-- Dynamic Analysis: Logic coverage testing (branch testing, path testing), code instrumentation

#### Logic Coverage Testing
-- Statement coverage
-- Decision coverage
-- Condition coverage
-- Path coverage
The statistics for logic coverage can be reflected through code instrumentation.

#### Code Instrumentation
When debugging code, we often insert print() statements in the program to easily print the information we need, helping us better understand some dynamic aspects of the program execution, such as the sequence of execution and the specific values of computed variables.

Code instrumentation allows users to obtain specific program information as required, making it an effective testing technique.

#### Advantages of Black-Box Testing
-- It is relatively simple and does not require knowledge of the program’s internal code or implementation.
-- It is independent of the software's internal implementation.
-- It comes from the user’s perspective, making it easier to identify which functions users will use and what problems they may encounter.
-- It is based on the software development documentation, so it can verify which functions in the documentation are implemented by the software.
-- It is more convenient when doing automated software testing.

#### Disadvantages of Black-Box Testing
-- Without clear testing specifications, test cases are difficult to design.
-- The reusability of automated testing is low.
-- It is impossible to control the internal program paths, so many test points may be missed.

#### Advantages of White-Box Testing
-- It helps software testers increase code coverage, improve code quality, and discover hidden problems in the code.

#### Disadvantages of White-Box Testing
-- There are many different execution paths in a program, and it is impossible to test all of them. Testing is based on the code, so it can only verify whether the developer’s implementation is correct, not whether the design is correct. Some functional requirements may be missed. In large systems, the cost of testing can be extremely high.

#### Gray-Box Testing
Gray-box testing lies between black-box and white-box testing. Depending on the information available about the object under test, different testing methods are used.

- When testing overall features of the object under test, black-box testing is used.
- When testing the internal implementation of the object under test, white-box testing is used.
By observing both the overall information of the tested object and its internal specifics, gray-box testing adopts a mix of both methods depending on the proportion of information available. This is known as gray-box testing.

#### Software Testing Documentation
Software development is like factory production. Throughout the process, there are two types of outputs:

-- The compiled code, such as QQ.exe

-- The user manual, such as a QQ user guide

-- Source code, such as QQ source code

-- Requirement Analysis: Basis for software testing.

-- High-Level Design: Based on the requirement analysis, design the solution to ensure all software requirements are covered.

-- Detailed Design: Includes the solution, strategy, architecture, system, interface names, interface documents, data structures, and algorithms to ensure detailed development.

-- Test Design: Details what needs to be tested, including which functional points should be covered and whether they affect other functions. For example, testing if the third-party payment page correctly redirects.

-- Test Cases: These are the rules and guidelines for testing, defining specific scenarios and expected outcomes.

-- Test Report: Includes the number of successful tests, the number of failed tests, whether the testing was passed, and whether the product is ready for release.

#### Static Testing vs. Dynamic Testing
-- Static Testing: Software testing that does not execute the software, such as code reviews, document reviews, and code analysis.
-- Dynamic Testing: Testing that runs the software system using preplanned test data and processes.

#### Static Analysis Techniques
-- Definition: Static analysis is a technique for analyzing software without executing it.

-- Function: Ensures the software functions as specified and has no apparent defects or ambiguities.

Test Points:

-- Consistency and completeness of program syntax
-- Standardization, accuracy, and clarity of documentation
-- Consistency between the program and its documentation

#### Dynamic Analysis Techniques
Dynamic analysis involves running the software system with specific data to compare actual results with expected outcomes.

-- Script recording tools: Used for repetitive testing, such as regression testing (e.g., Robot, QTP, Selenium).
-- Performance testing tools: Tools like LoadRunner, Robot, etc. are used for performance testing.



### Chapter 3: Testing Requirements
#### 3.1 Software Testing Requirements
Software Requirement Analysis is the outcome of studying user needs. It involves fully understanding the functional requirements for the software, confirming user needs, and establishing a basic basis that is verifiable and testable.

Software testing requirements are the foundation for designing test cases. They ensure the quality of the test, provide a measure for test coverage, and clarify how to test, when to test, and the necessary resources.

#### Software Testing Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is based on the type of product being developed, the source of the requirements, and the target user group. Different analyses are performed for different cases:

#### For specific product development
Requirement Source: Market analysis and research
User Group: Market researchers
Requirement Characteristics: Developing mainstream products based on market trends

#### For specific market development
Requirement Source: Customer requirements
Users: Designated client
Requirement Characteristics: Developing mainstream products based on market trends

#### For specific project development
Requirement Source: Customer requirements
Users: Designated client
Requirement Characteristics: Building what the client wants

#### Designing Testing Requirements Analysis
-- 1.Test points are extracted from requirement documents, and test cases are designed based on those points. Key testing aspects include correctness, necessity, priority, clarity, completeness, modifiability, and consistency.

-- 2.Functionality Testing: Analyze input, output, processing, limitations, and constraints described in the requirements to verify them.
-- 3.Interaction Testing: Analyze the sequence of operations between different modules, verify how information and data are exchanged.
UI Testing: Cover hidden requirements, like interface verification, account uniqueness, usability, compatibility, security, and performance under load.


### Chapter 4: Types of Testing

#### 4.1 What is a Test Plan?
A test plan is a document outlining the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities. It identifies the test items, features to be tested, assigned personnel, and any associated risks. It collects relevant project and product information, estimates the workload, and sets reasonable schedules and strategies.

Key Success Factors of a Project:
-- Time: Covered by the overall project schedule
-- Cost: Defined by the contract, determined by the client
-- Scope: Covered by the requirements documentation
-- Quality: Covered by the QA or test plan
Why Create a Test Plan?
A well-defined test plan ensures the testing process is organized, focused, and controlled. Without one, work becomes scattered and unstructured.


#### 4.2 Types of Testing Techniques
Software testing techniques can be broadly divided into two categories:

- 1. Static Testing
Static testing involves reviewing or examining the code, requirements, or design documents without actually executing the program. The goal is to find errors in documentation or code early in the development process. Examples include:

-- Code Reviews: Developers review each other's code to identify issues before it goes into production.
-- Walkthroughs: Team members discuss the logic and flow of the program to uncover potential problems.
-- Inspections: Formal, detailed review of documentation or code to ensure quality and compliance with standards.
Static testing helps in identifying issues early in the development cycle, which is cost-effective compared to dynamic testing.

- 2. Dynamic Testing
Dynamic testing requires executing the software to ensure it works as expected under specific conditions. It involves running the software and providing inputs to check if the actual output matches the expected output. This type of testing helps find defects that only appear when the code is running. Common examples of dynamic testing are:

-- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of the software.
-- Integration Testing: Testing combined parts of the system to verify they work together.
-- System Testing: End-to-end testing of the entire system to validate the integrated software meets the specified requirements.
-- Acceptance Testing: Ensuring the software meets the business needs and user requirements.
Static testing is focused on prevention, while dynamic testing is centered on identifying and fixing issues in a working system. Both are essential for maintaining high-quality software.



### Chapter 5: Defect Management
#### 5.1 What is a Defect?
A defect in software is any issue that does not meet user needs. From the internal perspective, it refers to errors or anomalies in the development or maintenance process. Externally, it refers to failing to fulfill certain functionalities.

#### 5.2 How Defects Are Identified:
-- Poor user experience leading to feedback
-- Visible error messages on the interface
-- Missing functionalities
-- System crashes or failures
-- Incorrect program logic
-- Poor performance under load

#### 5.3 Causes of Defects
Several reasons lead to software defects:

-- Changing Requirements: Constant changes or unclear requirements can introduce defects.
-- Short Deadlines & Complex Software: Tight schedules with complex codebases may lead to more errors.
-- Coding Errors: Mistakes made during the coding phase.
-- Incomplete Design Documents: Poorly documented designs or designs that lack clarity can result in misunderstandings.
-- Insufficient Communication: Poor collaboration or communication between teams.
-- Hardware/Software Limitations: Incompatibilities or unsupported features in the system’s environment.

#### 5.4 Common Software Defect Terminology

-- Defect (Bug/Fault): Errors in the software product that cause unintended behavior.
-- Fault: A malfunction in a component that prevents it from performing its intended function.
-- Failure: The system's inability to perform a required function.


#### 5.5 Types of Defects:
-- A. Missing Functionality: A feature or function specified in the requirements is missing.
-- B. Program Errors: The system does not behave as intended, possibly due to misunderstanding the requirements or coding mistakes.
-- C. Extra Functionality: A feature not required by the user or specification.

#### 5.6 Defect Reproduction
Defects can be categorized based on whether they can be reproduced or not:

-- Reproducible Defects: Defects that can be consistently triggered by following certain steps or conditions. These are clear, repeatable, and testable.
-- Non-Reproducible Defects: Defects that appear sporadically, with no clear pattern. These are often harder to diagnose and may require additional investigation.
-- Attempting Reproduction: Sometimes further investigation can turn a non-reproducible defect into a reproducible one, enabling proper documentation and resolution.


#### 5.7 Defect Reporting
Defect reports document any issues found during testing. They help developers locate and resolve problems and are also important for defect count and severity tracking.

- 5C Principles for Writing Defect Reports:
-- Correct: Accurate descriptions without causing confusion
-- Clear: Easy to understand
-- -- Concise: Only include necessary information
-- -- Complete: Full reproduction steps and essential details
-- Consistent: Use a consistent format throughout


#### 5.8 Defect Reporting - 5C Principle
When writing defect reports, the 5C principle ensures that the report is clear and useful:

-- Correct: The report should contain accurate and specific information.
-- Clear: The report should be easy to understand.
-- Concise: The report should include only necessary and essential information.
-- Complete: The report should contain all relevant steps and information needed to reproduce the defect.
-- Consistent: Follow a standard format throughout the report.

#### 5.9 Common Software Defects
Common defects in software testing include:

-- Functionality Bugs: Missing features, incorrect behavior of existing features.
-- UI/UX Issues: Misaligned elements, poor user interface interactions.
-- Performance Bugs: Slow system response, inability to handle large volumes of data.
-- Compatibility Issues: Software not functioning on certain platforms, devices, or environments.
-- Security Bugs: Vulnerabilities that can expose user data or system integrity.

#### 5.10 What is a Bug?
A bug refers to a flaw or imperfection in software. It can arise from discrepancies between user expectations (as documented in requirement specifications) and the software's behavior. Testing engineers are tasked with identifying these bugs and submitting them to developers for resolution.

#### 5.11 Bug Case Example
For instance, in a login system that requires a username and password:

-- If the correct username and password are entered but the system still shows an error message like "username not found," despite double-checking the credentials, this is a bug.
-- If a newly registered account cannot log in due to the same error, it indicates a systemic issue.

#### 5.12 Types of Bugs
Bugs can be classified into different types:

-- Code Errors: Bugs arising from incorrect logic or code.
-- Design Flaws: Problems stemming from flawed system or architectural design.
-- UI Optimization: Visual or aesthetic issues that affect user interaction.
-- Performance Issues: Problems causing slow or inefficient operations.
-- Configuration Problems: Incorrect configuration leading to improper behavior.
-- Deployment Issues: Bugs that arise during installation or deployment.
-- Security Vulnerabilities: Bugs that expose system data or allow unauthorized access.

#### 5.13 Severity of Bugs
Bugs are ranked based on their impact on the system:

-- Critical Errors: Issues causing system crashes, data breaches, or financial risks.
-- Major Errors: Key functionalities are unusable, like being unable to register or log in.
-- Minor Errors: Issues that do not affect system functionality but may impact user experience (e.g., UI problems).
-- Trivial Errors: Minor issues such as typos or punctuation errors that have little to no impact on functionality.

#### 5.14 Bug Handling Priorities
Priorities define how urgently a bug should be fixed:

-- Immediate: Critical bugs that disrupt the entire system or lead to serious issues like data loss.
-- High Priority: Bugs that significantly impact user experience or functionality but don’t cause a complete failure.
-- Medium Priority: Bugs that can be scheduled for future releases.
-- Low Priority: Bugs with little impact, often cosmetic or minor issues.

#### 5.15 Common Bug Management States
Bugs move through various stages in the development process:

-- New: Bug has been logged but not yet reviewed.
-- Open: Bug is being worked on.
-- Fixed: Bug has been addressed by developers.
-- Closed: Bug has been verified by testers as resolved.
-- Reopened: Bug was not properly fixed and needs to be addressed again.
-- Postponed: Fixing the bug has been delayed.
-- Rejected: The issue reported is not considered a bug.
-- Duplicate: The bug has already been reported.
-- Abandoned: After discussion, the bug is determined not to be fixed.

#### 5.16 Entry Criteria for Testing
Before starting the testing process, the following conditions must be met:

-- Development is complete, and unit testing in the development environment has passed.
-- All required functionalities are implemented, or any unimplemented functions are clearly communicated.
-- Integration testing is done, and basic flows are working.

### Chapter 6: Software Usability
#### 6.1 Definition of Usability
Usability refers to the ease with which users can interact with a software application. It is a key aspect of user experience. Usability is defined by aspects such as ease of understanding, ease of use, learnability, efficiency, error rates, and user satisfaction.

For instance, on e-commerce platforms like Taobao or JD.com, usability is continuously improved with regular updates to ensure the site remains easy to use without causing user confusion.

#### 6.2 Navigation Testing
Key considerations when determining if an application is easy to navigate include:

Is the navigation intuitive?
Can users access the main parts of the system easily from the homepage?
Does the system require a site map or search engine for navigation?
Chapter 7: Software Compatibility

#### 6.3 User Interface (UI) Testing
UI testing focuses on checking the software’s user interface, ensuring that the design, colors, fonts, and images are correctly implemented and consistent throughout the application. Key areas include:

-- Ergonomics: Ensuring the UI is easy to navigate and aligns with human usability standards.
-- Consistency: UI components like buttons, fonts, and colors should be uniform.
-- Appearance: Elements should be visually appealing and appropriate for the platform or device.
-- Functionality: Every UI element (buttons, links, images) should work as expected.

#### 6.4 Content Testing
In content testing, testers verify that all the information provided by the software is accurate and presented clearly. This includes:

-- Ensuring text is grammatically correct.
-- Verifying that all the content is relevant and up-to-date.
-- Checking for proper alignment of text, images, and multimedia content.

6.5 Overall UI Testing
Overall UI testing refers to assessing the software’s entire interface for usability and cohesion:

-- Ease of Navigation: Users should be able to locate information quickly.
-- Design Consistency: The overall design should feel consistent across the entire application.
-- User Experience: Evaluate how easy and pleasant it is to use the software from start to finish. The UI should be intuitive and require minimal effort to navigate effectively.


### Chapter 7: Software Compatibility
#### 7.1 Definition of Software Compatibility
Compatibility testing ensures that the software can run smoothly on different hardware platforms (e.g., PC, Mobile), software environments (e.g., browsers), operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS), and network environments (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi).

#### 7.2 The Role of Compatibility Testing
Enhances product quality and user experience
Ensures the software can interact with other systems smoothly
Increases the software's market competitiveness

#### 7.3 Testing Methods
Use real devices with specific system versions
Utilize cloud-based testing tools or emulators in special cases
For unavailable devices, select similar models as substitutes
